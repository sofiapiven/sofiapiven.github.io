                    Bulbulia, J. (in press). Kiwi Diwali: A Longitudinal Investigation of Perceived Social Connection 
                    Following a Civic Religious Ritual. <i>Religion, Brain & Behavior. X(X):X-XX</i>.</a></p> 
                
                    <p class="gentext"><b>Abstract:</b> Religious rituals are ubiquitous. Recent research indicates they can 
                    powerfully affect social connection, increasing collective sentiments and behaviors. However, the extent 
                    to which these effects depend on religious commitment remains unclear. Here, we use longitudinal data to 
                    investigate this question in a natural ritual setting by comparing the responses of religiously committed 
                    Hindus and non-Hindus immediately after a public Diwali celebration in New Zealand, and for two weeks following.
                    Effects of time and level of religious commitment are assessed on five targets that measure reported social 
                    connection of participants to themselves and to specific groups: “Myself”, “My family and friends”, “Work 
                    colleagues/university peers”, “People who celebrate Diwali”, and “Humanity in general.” We find that 
                    participation in the civic religious ritual affects social connection of all participants, with stronger 
                    effects among religiously committed Hindus. Private religious behavior appears integral to the mechanisms 
                    underpinning the amplification of solidarity at public rituals, as we find separation in the level of reported 
                    social connection to Diwali celebrants between practicing and non-practicing Hindus. Though religious 
                    commitment leads to greater perceived social connection, this study additionally demonstrates that in a 
                    religiously diverse democracy, a civic religious ritual may foster greater democratic unions across religious 
                    differences.</p>

                    <p class="gentext"><b>Abstract:</b> We leverage powerful time-series data from a national longitudinal sample 
                    measured before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the world's eighth most stringent COVID-19 lockdown 
                    (New Zealand, March-April 2020, N = 940) and apply Bayesian multilevel mediation models to rigorously 
                    test five theories of pandemic distress. Findings: (1) during lockdown, rest diminished distress; without 
                    rest psychological distress would have been about 1.74 times greater; (2) an elevated sense of community 
                    reduced distress, a little, but elevated government satisfaction was inert. Thus, the psychological benefits 
                    of lockdown extended to political discontents; (3) most lockdown distress arose from dissatisfaction from 
                    personal relationships. Social captivity, more than isolation, proved challenging; (4-5) Health and business 
                    satisfaction were stable; were they challenged substantially more distress would have ensued. Thus, lockdown 
                    benefited psychological health by affording safety, yet only because income remained secure. These national 
                    longitudinal findings clarify the mental health effects of stringent infectious disease containment.</p>
